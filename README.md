# Personal Portfolio – Assignment 1

A simple, responsive personal portfolio built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It introduces me, shows a few of my projects, and includes a contact form. This is the foundation for the professional portfolio I will expand in later assignments.

**Live demo:** https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/ID-FirstLast-assignment1/ *(replace after enabling GitHub Pages)*

## Features

## Run locally

No installation or build step is needed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/ID-FirstLast-assignment1.git
   cd ID-FirstLast-assignment1
   ```
2. Open the site using **one** of these options:
   - **Simplest:** double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
   - **VS Code:** install the *Live Server* extension, right-click `index.html`, and choose **Open with Live Server** (auto-reloads on save).
   - **Python:** run `python -m http.server 8000` in the project folder and visit http://localhost:8000.

## Using the site

- Click the links in the top bar (or the ☰ menu on mobile) to jump to a section.
- Click the round button at the end of the menu to switch between light and dark themes.
- Fill in the contact form and press **Send message**. Invalid fields show a message explaining how to fix them. Because there is no backend, nothing is actually emailed.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select `main` and `/ (root)`, then **Save**.
3. After about a minute the site is live at `https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`. Paste that link at the top of this README.

## AI use summary

I used Claude to generate the initial project scaffold, suggest a color palette and layout, and draft the documentation structure. I then reviewed every file, rewrote the content to describe my own background and projects, and tested the site in several browsers and screen sizes. Full details are in [docs/ai-usage-report.md](docs/ai-usage-report.md).
